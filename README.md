 DESCRIPTION  
   Calculates instructional days for a certain quarter to 
   schedule client authorizations. This awesome tool will save at
   least 30 minutes a year. I KNOW!

 TODO  
   - rewrite in purescript
   - it only works with a period in the same year
   - does not check if period is valid (e.g. 11/27 - 7/1)
   - add ranges (9/1..10/31) - would help in excluded dates
   - add frontend
